# Simple ECS Implementation

This is a simplified version of paullj's [Unity ECS implementation](https://github.com/paullj/unity-ecs-instanced-sprite-renderer). It was designed as a proof of concept for use in my current project.

The purpose of this implementation is instantiation speed. The current build can instantiate 3000 objects in under 16 milliseconds (1 frame at 60 FPS). This is a significant improvement compared to paullj's implementation (although I forgot exactly how fast it was). What's even better is this does not appear to require the use of Unity API's meaning it theoretically can be done in a secondary thread.

- Made in Unity 2018.1.4f1

Note: MonoBehaviour works just as well as a Component. We do not need to use Components. Although the fact Component overrides OnUpdate() instead of it being implicitly called like MonoBehaviour is very cool. Never liked how it was implicitly called in MonoBehaviour.

# Stats

- Instantiation (GameObject) >= 40ms (68ms, 79ms, 49ms, 48ms, 48ms, 42ms, 42ms, 52ms, 47ms, 43ms, 41ms, 45ms, 42ms)
- Instantiation (ECS) (not including asset loading) >= 7ms (total >= 11ms) (9ms, 9ms, 9ms, 8ms, 8ms, 9ms, 7ms) (Note: Initializing lists outside of stopwatch section does not appear to help at all. Also starting lists at size 1023 doesnâ€™t help at all either.)
- Instantiation (ECS threaded) >= 7ms (total >= 11 ms):
	- Start (6ms, 0ms) (likely using caching)
	- Meshes (11ms, 8ms, 5ms) (may be using caching)
	- Create (2ms, 3ms, 3ms, 3ms)

- Asset loading >= 4ms (5ms, 9ms, 4ms, 4ms, 9ms, 5ms, 10ms, 11ms)

- FPS (GameObject) ~ 80 FPS
- FPS (ECS) ~ 110 FPS
- FPS (ECS non-instanced) ~ 45-50 FPS
